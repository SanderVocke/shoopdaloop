# Assumption is that PyPi packages are used wherever possible.

# build stuff

libxkbcommon-dev

libjack-jackd2-dev
# note: qt6 needed to build because of its CMake build system
# providing simple means to register custom QML types. At runtime,
# having the PyPi PySide6 package is enough.
qt6-declarative-dev
# note: lv2, sord and serd needed at build-time only because it makes
# it very convenient to build lilv, serd and sord as static libraries.
# As static versions will be linked in, not needed at run-time.
