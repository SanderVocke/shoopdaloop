Controlling Tracks
--------------------


Volume Controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**ShoopDaLoop** tracks have two volume controls:

* The **input volume** governs volume of the track's input ports. All incoming signals are attenuated by this volume. This means it affects both monitoring and recording.
* The **output volume** governs volume of the track's output ports. All outgoing signals are attenuated by this volume. This means it affects both monitoring and playback.

Both volume controls come with:

* A **balance knob** if the in-/outputs are stereo for this track.
* A **mute button** to mute the track's in-/outputs. For the input this differs from the volume slider in that it only affects monitoring, not recording.
