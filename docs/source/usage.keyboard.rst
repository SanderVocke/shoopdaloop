Keyboard control
----------------

The computer keyboard can be used to control many aspects of **ShoopDaLoop**. Note that the keyboard control behavior is implemented as a custom **Lua script** (keyboard.lua),
which means that if so desired, you can make your own keyboard control modifications by duplicating the script and modifying it.

The help text of the default **keyboard.lua** is shown here for reference. Note that this help text can be opened any time from the Lua script settings menu as well.
