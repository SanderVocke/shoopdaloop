Controlling Loops
-----------------

Synchronization On/Off
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Loop mode transitions in **ShoopDaLoop** happen synchronized to the master loop. However, immediate actions can also be done if needed. To do so, turn *synchronization off* when performing the action. Note that this does not affect already queued actions or playing loops - only the actions done while turned off.

The *synchronization active* button at the top of the screen shows the current state of synchronization. A timer symbol (SYMBOL) means synchroniation on, an exclamation point (SYMBOL) means synchronization off.

There are two ways to control this:

* Click the button to toggle between the two modes;
* Synchronization is always off while a Ctrl key is held (usually easier).
