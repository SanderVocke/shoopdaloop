ShoopDaLoop
=======================================

**ShoopDaLoop** is an audio+MIDI live looping application for Linux with some DAW-like features.

The main intended use is for quickly expressing and experimenting with musical ideas without needing to record full end-to-end tracks for a whole song. It makes for a fun way to jam by oneself. Live performance could also be a good use-case, although at this point it is not quite battle-tested enough to recommend that (yet).

Although there is support for MIDI, **ShoopDaLoop** is geared towards working with (pieces of) live performance: there is no built-in MIDI sequencer or editor. Although MIDI/audio files can be directly loaded into loops, the most natural way to use **ShoopDaLoop** is to play MIDI or audio into its inputs on-the-fly.
