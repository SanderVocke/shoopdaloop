ShoopDaLoop
=======================================

**ShoopDaLoop** is a live looping application for Linux with a few DAW-like features.

The main intended use is for quickly expressing complex musical ideas without needing to record full end-to-end tracks for a whole song. It makes for a fun way to jam by oneself. Live performance could also be a good use-case, although it is not quite battle-tested enough to recommend that.
