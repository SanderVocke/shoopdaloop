# Loop-layer implementation and validation evidence

## Scope and provenance

`PLAN_LOOP_LAYER.md` governs this implementation. Its LL-A1–LL-A12 criteria are immutable without user approval. The initial runtime record in `DONE_INITIAL_CRATE.md` and `docs/rt_runtime/evidence/` is preserved; passing baseline tests is not evidence that new loop-layer behavior exists.

Execution was authorized through confirmed goal `mvnjf70y-cjcfar`. The implementation branch is `feat/loop-execution-layer`, based on `cc6ccb4ac35114d61ef7e1c03ecc7f2fe81bb867`. At branch creation, [runtime PR #878](https://github.com/SanderVocke/shoopdaloop/pull/878) remained open against `master`, with that same head. The delivery PR should initially target `feat/generic-rt-runtime` unless the parent merges before delivery; recheck rather than assuming its future status.

The pre-existing edits to `DESIGN_RT_ENGINE.md`, `PROPOSAL_RT_ENGINE.md`, and `PROPOSAL_LOOP_LAYER.md`, plus the new plan, are the intended architecture baseline. Unrelated `.pi/` state is left untouched and untracked. No production application integration is included.

## Acceptance-to-evidence map

These are required test/evidence groups, not claims of implementation. Add concrete test names and artifacts as stages complete.

| Criterion | Planned implementation/evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LL-A1 | Four-target dependency audits; both crate builds; native and Node/Chromium execution; host-only browser bindings | Pending new crate; original runtime baseline passes |
| LL-A2 | Generic synthetic planner dependency/view tests; resolver ownership tests; graph receiver validation | Pending |
| LL-A3 | Same-frame A → B → C and nested cascades; one-sample loops exceeding old subdivision allowances | Pending |
| LL-A4 | Semantic progress proof; valid mutual sync; rejected instantaneous recursion; generated valid/invalid programs | Pending |
| LL-A5 | Independent reference journals/audio/MIDI across callback partitions and declaration orders; exact end-boundary cases | Pending |
| LL-A6 | Debug/release/Wasm allocation/reallocation/deallocation canaries and guarded callback scopes; callback audit | Pending new paths; original runtime baseline passes |
| LL-A7 | Owning return/cancellation/generation/saturation/disconnect/teardown models; selected Miri and concurrency tests | Pending new paths |
| LL-A8 | Stereo/MIDI record-to-play, seek/replacement/cleanup/export; FX capture graph; common-prefix exhaustion | Pending |
| LL-A9 | Integrated prepared composites, primitive/composite interactions, and rendering-observation boundary tests | Pending |
| LL-A10 | Independent render/maintenance accounting, indexed access, capture reservations, counter/trace exhaustion, pool recovery | Pending |
| LL-A11 | New independent native/worklet fixture journals, actual Web Audio output, fixed-memory and failure gates; raw release measurements | Pending new fixture |
| LL-A12 | Updated runtime/loop guides and executable examples, acceptance audit, milestone commits, final-head CI and review record | Pending |

## Stage 0 — Verified pre-implementation baseline

Milestone: `docs(loop-layer): establish execution plan and verified baseline` (the commit introducing this section). No runtime, processor, resource, browser-host, or test behavior was changed in this milestone.

### Environment

Local Linux x86_64, repository `nix develop` environment:

- Rust/Cargo 1.97.1; installed targets `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- Prescribed cargo-nextest **0.9.116**, from `$HOME/.cache/rt-runtime-nextest-0.9.116`; the shell default 0.9.143 was not used for the suite.
- Node **22.22.2**, wasm-pack **0.15.0**, wasm-bindgen **0.2.127**, wasm-bindgen-test **0.3.77**.
- Chromium and ChromeDriver **147.0.7727.137**, with `CHROME_BIN` explicitly set.
- `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"` set for the baseline runner and child builds.

Exact environment overrides, commands, durations, exit statuses, log hashes, and package counts are in [`evidence/baseline-stage0.json`](evidence/baseline-stage0.json). Raw logs remain under `target/loop-layer-baseline/`. The runner was invoked as `nix develop --command python3 /tmp/loop-layer-baseline.py`; its individual commands are recorded in the report so the temporary orchestration file is not required for reproduction.

### Results

| Gate | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Main workspace and independent-host formatting | Passed |
| `cargo test --locked -p rt_runtime` | 93 passed, 0 failed/ignored |
| Same runtime tests, release | 93 passed, 0 failed/ignored |
| Warning-denied locked workspace build | Passed |
| Prescribed nextest full workspace, `shoop_engine/app_backend`, CI profile | 1893 passed, 4 existing ignored tests |
| Shared test attribute policy | Passed |
| Runtime production/build boundary, Linux/Windows/macOS/Wasm target trees | Passed |
| Boundary-audit Python tests | 2 passed |
| Runtime Wasm-test dependency isolation | Passed |
| Closed tracing inventory | Passed, 169 modules classified |
| Native host offline and two-thread replay, debug and release | Passed; exact response/sample checks |
| Fresh non-isolated offline/live AudioWorklet plus native replay | Passed |
| Deliberate processor and Rust heap worklet failure gates | Both detected, each child exited 1 as required |
| Fresh runtime Node and Chromium package suites | 89 passed each, 0 failed/ignored |

The four full-workspace ignored tests were enumerated from the nextest JSON test list: `intentional_failure_publishes_trace`, `native_result_failure_canary`, `shared_failure_canary_is_ignored_by_default`, and `shared_result_failure_canary_is_ignored_by_default`. They are existing opt-in failure canaries, not newly skipped loop/runtime coverage. Their binary IDs are retained in the report.

The Wasm package suites reused the runner's input-hash-validated application asset bundle; its metadata still records its earlier build SHA. The package tests were freshly executed, but this stage does not claim a fresh production-application browser smoke. The independent runtime worklet was separately built and executed.

### Actual worklet and native agreement

[`evidence/hosts-stage0.json`](evidence/hosts-stage0.json) records a fresh actual browser run:

- Offline: **2601 callbacks / 332928 frames**; sample hash **480331717**, MIDI hash **3308430490**, graph hash **487351092**, **34 MIDI events**. Both native offline and two-thread replays agree.
- Live: **13444 callbacks / 1720832 frames**, with acknowledged-time checks. Live message timing is not equated with deterministic offline timing.
- Independent instances and `cross_origin_isolated: false`; memory starts and ends at **1507328 bytes** with per-callback growth checks.
- Observed core work maxima: **1042 copied bytes / 512 validation steps** under the current runtime contract.
- Five withheld transfer credits, continued rendering for 2048 frames, duplicate/oversized refusal, delayed delivery, successful resource/ownership disposal, and both intentional failure sessions were exercised by the fixture.

The fresh uncompressed journal SHA-256 is `fb8ecf1fae2cb7ac7246bbb836d2ed7670f9d1341b8c005ab3d2565f07ee6237`, matching the initial golden journal. Neither the golden artifact nor historical evidence was replaced. [`native-debug-stage0.json`](evidence/native-debug-stage0.json) and [`native-release-stage0.json`](evidence/native-release-stage0.json) separately identify native-only replay as replay, not browser execution.

### Limits of this evidence

This establishes a clean local regression baseline for the inspected source, not the new loop-layer acceptance criteria. Windows/macOS execution, new loop-library behavior, new Miri cases, updated documentation/examples, and final PR CI remain future stage requirements. No browser/device hard-real-time or performance-improvement claim follows from these results.
