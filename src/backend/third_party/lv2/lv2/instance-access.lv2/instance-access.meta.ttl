This extension defines a feature which allows plugin UIs to get a direct handle
to an LV2 plugin instance (LV2_Handle), if possible.

Note that the use of this extension by UIs violates the important principle of
UI/plugin separation, and is potentially a source of many problems.
Accordingly, **use of this extension is highly discouraged**, and plugins
should not expect hosts to support it, since it is often impossible to do so.

To support this feature the host must pass an LV2_Feature struct to the UI
instantiate method with URI LV2_INSTANCE_ACCESS_URI and data pointed directly
to the LV2_Handle of the plugin instance.
