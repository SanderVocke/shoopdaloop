	lv2:documentation """

This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to map URIs to and from
integers.  This is usually used for performance reasons, for example for
processing events with URI types in real-time audio code).  Typically, plugins
map URIs to integers for things they "understand" at instantiation time, and
store those values for use in the audio thread without doing any string
comparison.  This allows for the extensibility of RDF but with the performance
of integers.

This extension is intended as an improved and simplified replacement for the
[uri-map](uri-map.html) extension, since the `map` context parameter there has
proven problematic.  This extension is functionally equivalent to the uri-map
extension with a NULL context.  New implementations are encouraged to use this
extension for URI mapping.
