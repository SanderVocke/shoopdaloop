Good Test Suite
===============

This suite contains tests that are "good" in the sense that they work as
expected in the normal direction: negative tests fail to parse, positive tests
with output produce exactly that output, down to the byte.

These tests are here, and not in the "perfect" suite, because they aren't
reversible for some reason or another.
